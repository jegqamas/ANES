- Changed default settings (now it is Stereo by default, it uses Hi-Res-Upscale by default)

- Added ability to toggle maximize mode by command-line (-maximized), TAB button press or mouse double click.
- Replaced frame-limiter timer with high resolution timer clocking on nanoseconds. Now fps is very accurate.
- Adjusted internal color values for better (and Agile Nes default) colors.
- Optimized Audio buffer-to-buffer synchronize, also fixed audio rendering issues such as speed push. Now it runs even better sound and performance
- Fixed Audio buffer adjusting using command-lines.
- Added support for mapper # 87.
- Changed default settings (now it is Mono by default instead of Stereo, it uses Point filter instead of Linear)

- Fixed colors (internal color configurations such as brightness and saturation)
- The emu uses filter point instead of linear by default.
- Updated fps timer (speed limiter timer), now it is more accurate
- Optimized Audio buffer-to-buffer synchronize, now it runs even better sound and performance

- Improved Audio Downsampler.
- Improved Audio generally.
- Improved performance by converting audio samples from integers into bytes.
- Audio now is output in unsigned 8 bit instead of signed 16 bit, it is correct for nes.
- Improved SDL2 Audio renderer, it sounds now better and stable.

### Notes:

- It may sound error sometimes with some games, but it is correct. Since nes sound output is about 179 MHz and
  Audio Channels might sound up to 444000 Hz, so downsampling from 444000 Hz into 44100 Hz will result a loss of resolution.
  Applying fixes like taking averages of samples proved to be wrong, so in My Nes, the downsampler now just do downsampling
  without any fix. This is correct but might sound error, this is normal due to the loss of resolution.
- Nes when outputing audio samples and mixed together, they are range from 0 into 1 in amplitude. If we try to convert
  that to 8 bit samples or signed 16 bits will result errors and corruption in sound. The correct convert is from 0-1 apm into
  0-127 value or 0 - 0x7F. My Nes now output sound in 8bits with range of 0 - 127, applying a simple fix as well that makes sure
  no sample is 0 (DB Fix, see <https://github.com/alaahadid/Docs/blob/main/Audio%20And%20DB.txt>) to make the sound 100 % correct.
- Performance is improved by using 8 bit audio samples instead of 16 bit samples, also renderer now control speed correctly to
  make sure audio samples are played correctly in time. This affect performance and accuracy of fps.

- Attempted to add mapper 9 and 10, they are not working for unknown reason. Will try latter.
- Returned first version memory switching methods.
- Changed default settings: high-res upscale is turned off, window size is set to 1, keep-aspect is off.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added MMC5 sound channels.
- Fixed mapper 5, now it support about 60-70 % of mapper 5 games.
